### **Difference Between Git and GitHub**

**Git** and **GitHub** are related but distinct tools used in version control and collaborative software development. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key differences:

---

### **1. Definition:**
- **Git**:
  - **Git** is a **version control system (VCS)** that helps developers track changes to the codebase and collaborate with others. It is a **local tool** that works on your local machine to manage files and versions of your code. Git helps in committing changes, branching, merging, and tracking the history of a project.
  
- **GitHub**:
  - **GitHub** is a **cloud-based hosting platform** that uses Git for version control. It allows developers to store their Git repositories online and collaborate with other developers. GitHub provides a web interface to interact with Git repositories, along with additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management.

---

### **2. Functionality:**
- **Git**:
  - Git is **software** that helps you manage your code locally. It allows you to:
    - Track changes (commits)
    - Create branches for new features or bug fixes
    - Merge branches into the main codebase
    - Revert changes and maintain a history of all code changes
  
- **GitHub**:
  - GitHub is a **service** that hosts Git repositories and provides features to work with them online, such as:
    - Online Git repository hosting
    - Collaboration tools (like pull requests, issues, and discussions)
    - Code reviews and feedback
    - Continuous Integration (CI) integrations
    - Project management features (e.g., kanban boards, milestones)

---

### **3. Storage:**
- **Git**:
  - Git stores the repository **locally** on your computer. You have the full history of your project on your local machine, which means you can work offline and perform operations like commit, branch, and merge without an internet connection.
  
- **GitHub**:
  - GitHub stores the repository **remotely** on their cloud servers, allowing you to share your code with others and collaborate easily. GitHub is typically used to **push** and **pull** code to and from the remote repository.

---

### **4. Collaboration:**
- **Git**:
  - Git allows **individual developers** to track changes and manage their code locally. For collaboration, multiple developers can work with Git on their local machines, but sharing code and changes requires a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
  
- **GitHub**:
  - GitHub is specifically designed for **collaborative development**. It provides tools such as **pull requests**, **issue tracking**, and **wikis** to enable multiple developers to contribute to the same project. Developers can propose changes, review code, and collaborate efficiently on GitHub.

---

### **5. Usage:**
- **Git**:
  - Git is used for **local version control**. It runs on your local machine and can work entirely offline. You perform tasks like committing changes, viewing history, and creating branches directly on your computer.
  
- **GitHub**:
  - GitHub is used for **online version control**. It works with Git repositories by providing a remote location where developers can store their code and share it with others. GitHub facilitates collaboration through web-based tools, including pull requests, issues, and discussions.

---

### **6. Key Features:**
- **Git**:
  - Distributed version control
  - Works offline
  - Tracks local changes and version history
  - Branching and merging

- **GitHub**:
  - Repository hosting
  - Pull requests for code review and collaboration
  - Issue tracking for bugs and features
  - Project management tools (e.g., kanban, milestones)
  - Continuous integration and deployment (via GitHub Actions)
  - Social features (e.g., forking, starring repositories)

### **Differences:**

| **Feature**           | **Git**                               | **GitHub**                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Type**              | Version control system (VCS)         | Cloud-based Git repository hosting     |
| **Function**          | Manages versions of code locally     | Hosts code remotely and facilitates collaboration |
| **Installation**      | Installed on your local machine      | Cloud-based service (web platform)     |
| **Collaboration**     | Local version control, needs remote hosting for sharing | Provides tools for remote collaboration (e.g., pull requests, issues) |
| **Storage**           | Local repositories                    | Remote repositories on GitHub servers  |
| **Internet Requirement** | No need for internet (works offline) | Requires internet for cloud access    |
| **Examples**          | Git command line tools               | GitHub website and GitHub Desktop app |

### **Note:**
- **Git** is the underlying **version control system** that helps manage changes in your code locally.
- **GitHub** is a **platform** that leverages Git to host repositories, facilitate collaboration, and manage projects online. It provides additional features and tools to make working with Git more accessible and efficient, especially for teams.

Git is the **tool**, and GitHub is the **service** built around that tool for collaborative code sharing and version control.
