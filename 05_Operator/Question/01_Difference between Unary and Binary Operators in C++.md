### **Difference between Unary and Binary Operators in C++**

#### **1. Unary Operators**
- **Definition**: Unary operators are operators that operate on **only one operand**. They perform operations on a single value or variable.
- **Functionality**: These operators are typically used for incrementing, decrementing, negating, or addressing operations.
- **Example Operations**: Increment (`++`), Decrement (`--`), Logical NOT (`!`), Bitwise NOT (`~`), Unary minus (`-`), and Unary plus (`+`).

#### **Examples**:

1. **Unary Plus (`+`)**: It indicates a positive value. Although itâ€™s not used much, it can be applied to express a positive number explicitly.
    ```cpp
    int a = 5;
    int b = +a;  // Unary plus, results in 5
    ```

2. **Unary Minus (`-`)**: It negates the value of the operand.
    ```cpp
    int a = 5;
    int b = -a;  // Unary minus, results in -5
    ```

3. **Increment (`++`)**: Increases the value of the operand by 1.
    ```cpp
    int a = 5;
    a++;  // Post-increment: a becomes 6
    ```

4. **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
    ```cpp
    int a = 5;
    --a;  // Pre-decrement: a becomes 4
    ```

5. **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Inverts the boolean value of an expression.
    ```cpp
    bool flag = true;
    cout << !flag;  // Outputs: 0 (false)
    ```

#### **2. Binary Operators**
- **Definition**: Binary operators are operators that operate on **two operands**. They perform operations between two values or variables.
- **Functionality**: These operators are used for arithmetic operations, relational operations, logical operations, bitwise operations, and more.
- **Example Operations**: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Modulus (`%`), Relational (`>`, `<`, `==`), Logical AND (`&&`), etc.

#### **Examples**:

1. **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands together.
    ```cpp
    int a = 5, b = 3;
    int result = a + b;  // Binary addition, result is 8
    ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
    ```cpp
    int a = 5, b = 3;
    int result = a - b;  // Binary subtraction, result is 2
    ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.
    ```cpp
    int a = 5, b = 3;
    int result = a * b;  // Binary multiplication, result is 15
    ```

4. **Relational (`==`, `!=`)**: Compares two operands for equality or inequality.
    ```cpp
    int a = 5, b = 3;
    cout << (a == b);  // Binary comparison, results in false (0)
    ```

5. **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
    ```cpp
    bool a = true, b = false;
    bool result = a && b;  // Binary logical AND, result is false
    ```

### **Key Differences**:
| **Aspect**            | **Unary Operators**                                      | **Binary Operators**                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Number of Operands** | Operates on **one operand**                             | Operates on **two operands**                        |
| **Examples**           | `++`, `--`, `!`, `-`, `+`, `~`                           | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=`      |
| **Function**           | Performs operations on a single value or variable        | Performs operations between two values or variables  |
| **Use Case**           | Used for incrementing, decrementing, negating, or logical negation | Used for performing mathematical, logical, or relational operations between two values |

### **Note:**:
- **Unary operators** work on a **single operand** and often modify or negate the value.
- **Binary operators** work on **two operands** and are typically used for arithmetic, relational, logical, and other operations between two values.

Understanding the distinction between these operators helps in writing efficient code and makes the logic of your program clearer and more readable.
