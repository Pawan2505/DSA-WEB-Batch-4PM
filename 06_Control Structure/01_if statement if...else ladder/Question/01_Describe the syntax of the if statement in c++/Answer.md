**Interviewer:**

"Could you please describe the syntax of the `if` statement in C++?"

**Answer:**

"Sure! In C++, the `if` statement is used to execute a block of code based on whether a given condition evaluates to `true` or `false`. It allows the program to make decisions and control the flow of execution.

### **Syntax of the `if` Statement:**

The basic syntax of an `if` statement looks like this:

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **condition**: This is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value (either `true` or `false`). It can be any valid expression, such as a comparison (`x > 5`), a logical condition (`x && y`), or any other condition that can be converted to a boolean.
- **Code block**: This is the block of code that gets executed **only if** the condition evaluates to `true`. If the condition evaluates to `false`, this block is skipped.

### **Example:**

```cpp
int age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    cout << "You are an adult." << endl;
}
```

In this example:
- The `condition` is `age >= 18`, which checks if the value of `age` is greater than or equal to 18.
- If the condition is `true` (since 20 is greater than 18), the code `cout << "You are an adult." << endl;` gets executed.

### **Optional `else` Block:**
You can also use the `else` keyword to provide an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is `false`:

```cpp
if (age >= 18) {
    cout << "You are an adult." << endl;
} else {
    cout << "You are a minor." << endl;
}
```

Here:
- If `age` is greater than or equal to 18, it will print "You are an adult."
- If `age` is less than 18, it will print "You are a minor."

---

**Note:**
- The `if` statement checks a condition.
- If the condition is true, the associated block of code runs.
- The optional `else` block can be used to handle the case when the condition is false.

Does that make sense?"
