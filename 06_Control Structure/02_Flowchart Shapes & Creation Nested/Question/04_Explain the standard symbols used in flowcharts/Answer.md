### **Question:**

**Explain the standard symbols used in flowcharts.**

---

### **Answer:**

In a flowchart, different shapes (or symbols) are used to represent different types of operations, processes, decisions, and more. These symbols help visually represent the flow of control and actions in a process or algorithm. Below are the most commonly used flowchart symbols and their meanings:

---

### **1. Oval (Terminator)**:

- **Purpose**: Represents the **start** or **end** of a process.
- **Description**: The oval shape indicates where the process begins or ends.
- **Example**: "Start" or "End" of the program.

**Symbol**:

### **2. Rectangle (Process)**:

- **Purpose**: Represents an **action** or **operation** that the program performs (e.g., a calculation, assignment, or any task).
- **Description**: It shows the actual process being performed in the flow, like manipulating data, calculating a value, or setting a variable.
- **Example**: Assigning a value to a variable or performing a calculation.

**Symbol**:

### **3. Parallelogram (Input/Output)**:

- **Purpose**: Represents **input** or **output** operations.
- **Description**: This symbol is used when data is being read from the user or output is being shown to the user. It indicates when the program gets input or displays output.
- **Example**: Asking for user input, or printing a message to the screen.

### **4. Diamond (Decision)**:

- **Purpose**: Represents a **decision** or a **branch** point, where the program chooses between two or more paths based on a condition.
- **Description**: A decision symbol checks a condition and typically has two outputs: "Yes" or "No," representing different paths of execution based on the result of the condition.
- **Example**: An `if` statement, where the program checks if a number is greater than 0 and decides what to do next.

### **5. Arrow (Flow Line)**:

- **Purpose**: Represents the **flow of control** or the **direction of execution**.
- **Description**: The arrows connect the flowchart symbols and show the sequence in which the operations or decisions happen. They guide the reader through the flow of the program.
- **Example**: Connecting the different operations or decisions in the flowchart.

### **6. Circle (Connector)**:

- **Purpose**: Used to represent **continuation** of the flow in large flowcharts, especially when the chart is split into multiple sections.
- **Description**: This symbol is used to avoid long lines or to connect different parts of a flowchart when space is limited. It essentially links one part of the flowchart to another.
- **Example**: Connecting two different parts of the flowchart, especially in complex designs.

**Symbol**:

### **7. Document**:

- **Purpose**: Represents a **document** or **report** being generated or output.
- **Description**: This symbol is used when a report or document is created as part of the process.
- **Example**: Creating a printed report as the output of a program.

**Symbol**:

---

### **8. Manual Input**:

- **Purpose**: Represents **manual input** from the user.
- **Description**: This symbol is specifically used when the program requires data input manually by the user.
- **Example**: A user entering their name, age, or other details into a program.

### **Standard Flowchart Symbols:**

| **Symbol**              | **Purpose**            | **Description**                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Oval (Terminator)**   | Start/End              | Marks the beginning or end of the flowchart.                                                                        |
| **Rectangle (Process)** | Process/Operation      | Represents a task, calculation, or operation in the program.                                                        |
| **Parallelogram (I/O)** | Input/Output           | Represents data input (e.g., user input) or output (e.g., displaying results).                                      |
| **Diamond (Decision)**  | Decision/Condition     | Represents a decision point where a condition is evaluated (e.g., `if` statement). Has two outcomes: "Yes" or "No". |
| **Arrow (Flow Line)**   | Flow/Direction         | Indicates the direction of control flow between symbols.                                                            |
| **Circle (Connector)**  | Connector/Continuation | Used to connect different parts of a flowchart, especially in larger charts.                                        |
| **Document**            | Document/Report        | Represents the creation of a report or document as part of the process.                                             |
| **Manual Input**        | Manual Input           | Represents data input from the user manually.                                                                       |

### **Note:**:

The standard symbols used in flowcharts provide a universal way to visually communicate the flow of a process or program. By using these symbols, developers can plan and represent their algorithms in a simple and clear manner, making the logic easier to understand, troubleshoot, and implement.
