### **Question:**

**Provide a concise syntax for a switch-case statement. Briefly explain the typical structure of a switch-case construct.**

---

### **Answer:**

A **switch-case** statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of a variable. It's typically used as a cleaner alternative to multiple `if-else` conditions when you need to check a variable against several possible values.

### **Concise Syntax**:

```cpp
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block for value2
        break;
    case value3:
        // Code block for value3
        break;
    default:
        // Code block if no case matches
}
```

### **Explanation**:

- **expression**: The variable or value being tested.
- **case valueX**: A specific value to match against the expression. If it matches, the corresponding code block is executed.
- **break**: Exits the `switch` statement, preventing the execution of subsequent cases.
- **default**: (Optional) A default case to handle if none of the `case` values match the expression.

### **Example**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int day = 3;

    switch (day) {
        case 1:
            cout << "Monday" << endl;
            break;
        case 2:
            cout << "Tuesday" << endl;
            break;
        case 3:
            cout << "Wednesday" << endl;
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Invalid day" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Example**:

- The `switch` statement evaluates the variable `day` (which is `3`).
- It matches the case `3` and prints "Wednesday".
- If no case matches, the `default` case would be executed.

### **Note:**:

The `switch-case` statement provides a cleaner way to handle multiple conditions for a single variable. It is useful when there are many possible values to check, making the code more readable compared to using multiple `if-else` statements.
