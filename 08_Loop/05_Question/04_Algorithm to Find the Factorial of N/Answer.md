### **Algorithm to Find the Factorial of N**

The following algorithm calculates the factorial of a given number `N` where:
- If `N` is less than or equal to 1, the output will be `1` (as `0!` and `1!` are both defined as `1`).
- Otherwise, it computes the factorial using a loop.

---

### **Algorithm**

1. **Start**
2. **Input**: Read the integer `N` (the number for which the factorial needs to be calculated).
3. **Check**: If `N <= 1`:
   - **Action**: Output the value `1` (as `0! = 1` and `1! = 1`).
4. **Else**: Initialize `factorial = 1`.
5. **Loop**: For each `i` from `1` to `N`:
   - Multiply `factorial` by `i`: `factorial = factorial * i`.
6. **Output**: After the loop ends, display the value of `factorial`.
7. **End**

### **Example**

#### **Input**: `N = 5`

#### **Output**: `Factorial of 5 = 120`

Explanation:
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

---

#### **Example for N <= 1**

#### **Input**: `N = 1`

#### **Output**: `Factorial of 1 = 1`

Explanation:
- By the rule, `1! = 1`.

### **Explanation of the Flowchart:**

1. **Start**: The program starts by asking the user for the input number `N`.
2. **Input N**: The value of `N` is read.
3. **Condition Check**: If `N <= 1`, the program outputs `1` and ends.
4. **Factorial Calculation**: If `N > 1`, the program initializes `factorial` as `1` and loops from 1 to `N`, updating the `factorial` value by multiplying it with `i` in each iteration.
5. **Output**: After completing the loop, the program outputs the calculated factorial.
6. **End**: The program ends.

### **Example of Code Implementation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N;
    cout << "Enter a number to find its factorial: ";
    cin >> N;

    // If N is less than or equal to 1, output 1
    if (N <= 1) {
        cout << "Factorial of " << N << " is 1" << endl;
    }
    else {
        int factorial = 1;
        // Loop to calculate factorial
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }
        cout << "Factorial of " << N << " is " << factorial << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Output Example**

#### **Input**: `N = 5`
```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

#### **Input**: `N = 1`
```
Factorial of 1 is 1
```
