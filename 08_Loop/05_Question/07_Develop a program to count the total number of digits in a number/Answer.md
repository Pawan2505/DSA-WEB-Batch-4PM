To develop a program that counts the total number of digits in a given number, we can follow a simple approach. The algorithm will repeatedly divide the number by 10 and count how many times this operation can be done until the number becomes 0. Each division by 10 reduces the number by one digit, so the total number of divisions will give the total number of digits.

### **Algorithm**

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Input**: Read the integer number `N`.
3. **Check**: If the number is zero, then the digit count is 1 (as 0 has 1 digit).
4. **Initialize** a counter variable `count = 0` to keep track of the number of digits.
5. **Loop**: While `N` is not equal to 0:
   - Divide `N` by 10 (integer division).
   - Increment the `count` by 1.
6. **Output**: Print the value of `count`, which will be the total number of digits.
7. **End** the program.

### **Code Implementation in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> N;

    // Handle case for number 0
    if (N == 0) {
        cout << "Total number of digits: 1" << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    int count = 0;

    // Loop to count the digits
    while (N != 0) {
        N /= 10;  // Divide the number by 10
        count++;   // Increment the digit count
    }

    // Output the total number of digits
    cout << "Total number of digits: " << count << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Input**: The program prompts the user to enter an integer `N`.
2. **Special Case for Zero**: If `N` is 0, the program directly outputs that the number has 1 digit, as 0 itself is a single digit.
3. **Counting Digits**: The while loop runs as long as `N` is not zero. In each iteration, `N` is divided by 10 (removing the last digit), and the counter `count` is incremented by 1. This continues until `N` becomes 0.
4. **Output**: The final count of digits is printed.

### **Example Run**

#### **Input 1**:
```
Enter a number: 12345
```

#### **Output 1**:
```
Total number of digits: 5
```

#### **Input 2**:
```
Enter a number: 987654321
```

#### **Output 2**:
```
Total number of digits: 9
```

#### **Input 3**:
```
Enter a number: 0
```

#### **Output 3**:
```
Total number of digits: 1
```
